This is all the main code for my Crochet Critic website.
This is mostly just a static site for now until I learn more JavaScript and can possibly make it into an ecommerce site.
For the most part, I will be using this site as a learning ground for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and learning frontend and backend frameworks.
More to be added soon!
