        <span class="date">Thursday, May 23, 2024 - Oh, crochet! by Crochet Critic</span>	
        <br>
        Crochet is more than just an old fashioned hobby. So much more. 
        It is a feeling of creativity, a feeling that something grand is 
        going to be accomplished. Then when you are nearing the end of your 
        crochet creation, it&#39;s so unbelievably satisfying to finish that 
        last stitch. You finally stare at your  invention with awe. Can you 
        believe that you took a ball of yarn, a jumbled up mess of string, 
        and worked it into knots with your hook until somehow it magically 
        became a sweater? That same ball of yarn would still be sitting 
        quietly and sadly on the shelf at the craft store if you hadn&#39;t 
        brought it home, and now it has been shaped into something beautiful 
        and functional. That is more than just a hobby, my friends. It&#39;s 
        poetry. Pure, wonderful, unrestricted poetry. You can easily brush 
        crochet off as boring. Or you can join the millions of people 
        across the globe that have a passion for this centuries old art 
        form. It is a free range expression that can become anything you 
        can imagine.
        <br><br>
        I&#39;ve met people who don&#39;t understand crochet or the process 
        involved. They write it off as a worthless hobby not important 
        enough to learn. Which is extremely sad, because it&#39;s a craft 
        that has been handed down for hundreds of years. It has been 
        around for centuries and many researchers believe that the craft 
        has origins in Scotland and the British Isles, but has actually 
        been seen in all parts of Europe. It was often referred to as 
        &#39;shepherd&#39;s knitting&#39;. Basically, crochet is the art of creating 
        knots and loops with thread or yarn with a hook of the
        corresponding size, usually made out of carved wood or bone. It 
        is a traditional past time but it was also used as a necessity. 
        In the old days, if you didn&#39;t have money to buy a coat, scarf, 
        or hat, the next best thing was to make it yourself. In present 
        times, it is most widely used as a recreational activity to 
        create functional and fashionable garments, toys, blankets, art 
        pieces, and much more. It can also be said that crochet helps 
        with anxiety and focus. Once you understand the basics, you can 
        crochet without so much as a second thought. 
        <br><br>
        It is also a fast moving craft. Unlike knitting, crochet builds on rows very 
        quickly without having to pause and wrap yarn around a needle. 
        It&#39;s faster to learn than knitting because instead of holding 
        two needles and holding working yarn, you just have to hold the 
        yarn in one hand and the hook in the other.
        <br><br>
        So the real question is…..crochet or knitting?
        <br><br>
        Okay, so since I am the Crochet Critic…I may be biased…and may 
        have to pick crochet, but if you are a yarn craft newcomer, both 
        arts are very similar. It can be very difficult to see a difference 
        if you&#39;ve never picked up either craft before. How can you, an 
        absolute beginner, know which will be the easiest to learn, fastest 
        to work, most secure, most beautiful, most versatile art? Well, 
        children, gather around and your crochet godmother will definitely 
        drop some sweet knowledge on your brain. The answer is really quite 
        simple…

        Crochet. As for why I pick crochet…well, I guess you&#39;ll just have 
        to come back for the next blog post, won&#39;t you?
